IAM Authentication methods are 3 types
1. Access Key
2. Console Password
3. Signing Certificate


Access Key
==========
- Access Key is used for API
- Access Key is a comnbination of an access key ID and a secret access key
- These can be used to make programmatic calls to AWS when using the API in program code or at a command prompt when using the AWS CLI 
  or the AWS power shell tools.
- You can create, modify, view or rotate access key using the command prompt
- When created IAM returns the access key ID and secret access key.
- The secret access key is returned only at the creation time and if lost a new key must be created.
- Ensure access keys and secret keys are stored securely
- Users can be given access to change their own keys through IAM policy (not from the console). 
- You can disable a userâ€™s access key which prevents it from being used for API calls


IAM Console Password
====================
- A password that the user can enter to sign into interactive sessions such as the
AWS Management Console
- You can allow users to change their own passwords
- You can allow selected IAM users to change their passwords by disabling the option
for all users and using an IAM policy to grant permissions for the selected users


IAM Server Certificate / Signing Certificate
============================================
- SSL/TLS certificates that you can use to authenticate with some AWS services
- AWS recommends that you use the AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to provision, 
manage and deploy your server certificates
- Use IAM only when you must support HTTPS connections in a region that is not
supported by ACM
