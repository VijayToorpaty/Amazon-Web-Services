IAM Authentication methods are 3 types
1. Access Key
2. Console Password
3. Signing Certificate


Access Key
==========
- Access Key is used for API
- Access Key is a comnbination of an access key ID and a secret access key
- These can be used to make programmatic calls to AWS when using the API in program code or at a command prompt when using the AWS CLI 
  or the AWS power shell tools.
- You can create, modify, view or rotate access key using the command prompt
- When created IAM returns the access key ID and secret access key.
- The secret access key is returned only at the creation time and if lost a new key must be created.
- Ensure access keys and secret keys are stored securely
- Users can be given access to change their own keys through IAM policy (not from the console). 
- You can disable a userâ€™s access key which prevents it from being used for API calls


IAM Console Password
====================
- A password that the user can enter to sign into interactive sessions such as the
AWS Management Console
