AWS Security Token Service (STS)

- The AWS Security Token Service (STS) is a web service that enables you to request temporary,
limited-privilege credentials for IAM users or for users that you authenticate (federated users).

- By default, AWS STS is available as a global service, and all AWS STS requests go to a 
single endpoint at https://sts.amazonaws.com

- All regions are enabled for STS by default but can be disabled

- The region in which temporary credentials are requested must be enabled

- Credentials will always work globally
